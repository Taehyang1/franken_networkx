</div>

FrankenNetworkX is a high-performance, Rust-backed drop-in replacement for [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/). Use it as a standalone library or as a NetworkX backend with zero code changes.

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install franken-networkx
```

### Standalone usage

```python
import franken_networkx as fnx

G = fnx.Graph()
G.add_edge("a", "b", weight=3.0)
G.add_edge("b", "c", weight=1.5)

path = fnx.shortest_path(G, "a", "c", weight="weight")
pr = fnx.pagerank(G)
components = fnx.connected_components(G)
```

### NetworkX backend (zero code changes)

```python
import networkx as nx
nx.config.backend_priority = ["franken_networkx"]

# All supported algorithms now dispatch to Rust automatically
G = nx.path_graph(100)
nx.shortest_path(G, 0, 99)
```

## Graph Types

- `Graph` -- undirected graph
- `DiGraph` -- directed graph (algorithms automatically convert to undirected where needed)

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- No Rust toolchain needed for `pip install` (pre-built wheels provided)

## Development

```bash
pip install maturin
maturin develop --features pyo3/abi3-py310
pytest tests/python/ -v
```

## What Makes This Project Special

Canonical Graph Semantics Engine (CGSE): deterministic tie-break policies with complexity witness artifacts per algorithm family.

This is treated as a core identity constraint, not a best-effort nice-to-have.

## Methodological DNA

This project uses four pervasive disciplines:

1. alien-artifact-coding for decision theory, confidence calibration, and explainability.
2. extreme-software-optimization for profile-first, proof-backed performance work.
3. RaptorQ-everywhere for self-healing durability of long-lived artifacts and state.
4. frankenlibc/frankenfs compatibility-security thinking: strict vs hardened mode separation, fail-closed compatibility gates, and explicit drift ledgers.

## V1 Scope

- Graph, DiGraph, MultiGraph core semantics; - shortest path/components/centrality/flow scoped sets; - serialization core formats.

## Architecture Direction

graph API -> graph storage -> algorithm modules -> analysis and serialization

## Compatibility and Security Stance

Preserve NetworkX-observable algorithm outputs, tie-break behavior, and graph mutation semantics for scoped APIs.

Defend against malformed graph ingestion, attribute confusion, and algorithmic denial vectors on adversarial graphs.

## Performance and Correctness Bar

Track algorithm runtime tails and memory by graph size/density; gate complexity regressions for adversarial classes.

Maintain deterministic graph semantics, tie-break policies, and serialization round-trip invariants.

## Key Documents

- AGENTS.md
- COMPREHENSIVE_SPEC_FOR_FRANKENNETWORKX_V1.md

## Next Steps

1. Expand fixture corpus to larger legacy families for matching and additional centrality variants.
2. Expand flow-family coverage beyond max-flow + min-cut (directed semantics hardening, larger adversarial flow fixtures, and stress fixtures).
3. Add format breadth beyond edgelist/json (adjlist/graphml scoped paths).
4. Add benchmark families and p50/p95/p99 regression gates across centrality and flow workloads.
5. Tighten strict/hardened drift budgets with per-family parity thresholds.

## Porting Artifact Set

- PLAN_TO_PORT_NETWORKX_TO_RUST.md
- EXISTING_NETWORKX_STRUCTURE.md
- PROPOSED_ARCHITECTURE.md
- FEATURE_PARITY.md

These four docs are now the canonical porting-to-rust workflow for this repo.
